In order to validate essays, it uses the copyleaks API to check for plagiarism. It also uses a modified version of GPT-2 to detect the likelihood that the text was real or fake. Then it outputs a validation score using these 2 scores. In order to grade the essay, it uses a neural network model trained on the automatic essay grading dataset on Kaggle found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes/data .Take this code and go build a profitable startup with it.
